I developed the backend logic for a book-keeping system, allowing users to manage books and authors by adding and deleting entries. Implemented password encryption, role-based access control, and account-based restrictions using Spring Security to ensure data protection and secure user account management. The project was built using Spring Framework, Java, and PostgreSQL, providing a secure and efficient data management solution.
